Im Luka Goff,
I like to play video games, sports, travel, I speak 3 lagauges, play the saxaphone, and figet with technology. I like to play football and basketball. I've lived in Thialand and now Jordan. I visist serbia and croatia because I have family there. The three langauges i speak are serbian, croation and of course english and im learning arabic and spanish too. I like technology in genoroll. I wanted to build a Pc for gaming so i had to learn all the parts and how they functioned and once I learned that my mind was blown away how expensive all the parts were so I saved all of that for later. I have played the saxaphone for 4-5 years now and have participated in many concerts and solo avents.
