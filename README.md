I visist serbia and croatia because I have family there. The three langauges i speak are serbian, croation and of course english and im learning arabic and spanish too. I like technology in genoroll. I wanted to build a Pc for gaming so i had to learn all the parts and how they functioned and once I learned that my mind was blown away how expensive all the parts were so I saved all of that for later
